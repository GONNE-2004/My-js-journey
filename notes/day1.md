YYYY-MM-DD
[Go to Variables Folder](file:../basics/variables/variable.js)

🔍 What I Learned Today
1- learnt the different way to join/ concatenate string
2- learnt how to declare variable using let and const
3- learnt cameCase eg firstName
4- learnt how to print on the console

🧠 Key Takeaways
1- when "let" is used, it allows one the ability to reassign new value to an alread declared variable
2- when "conts" is used then the declared variable should be assigned a value then which can't be changed
3 one should be mindful when using "+" to concatenate, it at times cause spacing issues

❓ Questions / Things to Review Later
1- use "let" if you are expecting your values to change over time
2- use "const" for an unchangeable things

🔥 Tomorrow’s Plan
1- continue the variable section
