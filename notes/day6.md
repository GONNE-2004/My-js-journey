🔍 What I Learned Today
1-Created a small function project that finds which year is leap year, had to use the if-else statement and strict equality operator

2-Created  function project that masks part of an email using asterik, had to use to the slice(), index() & repeat() methods then concatenate the final output

3-Created a truncate function project that takes 2 argument string and number, the length of the string is compared to the number if similar left then appended "..." at the end and if length longer than number it's sliced then appedned "..." at string end

🧠 Key Takeaways
1-learnt how to utilise function in writing small scipts
2-learnt the various use of methods like slice() and others in small scripts

❓ Questions / Things to Review Later
1-When writing the logic for the leap yr always start with 400 in order not to skip yr like 2000,then use 100 & finally 4
2-The uses of the methods in this chapter were abit tricky so check if possible

🔥 Tomorrow’s Plan
1-Start Array chapter
