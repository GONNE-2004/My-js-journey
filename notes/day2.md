[Go to Variables Folder](file:../basics/variables/workString.js)

🔍 What I Learned Today
1- Learnt about using escape (\) which literally make the things before mean as they are not as a special character in js
2- (\n) creates a newline
3- Using template literals and string interpolation which allows easy insertion of varaibles and expression
e.g(`My name is ${name} and am ${age}.`). it makes things readable and easy to understand
4- Using the length method to find the last character of string
e.g subject[subject.length - 1]
5- Using the (indexOf) method to find a substring in a string
e.g console.log(learningIsFunSentence.indexOf("Learning"));
6- Using the bracket notation to a character in a string
e.gconsole.log(subject[1]);

🧠 Key Takeaways
1- indexOf method is case sentive meaning (learning & Learinng) are 2 different things
and if it doesn't find the supposed string it will return (-1)

❓ Questions / Things to Review Later
1- the use of indexOf method
2- the way to find the last character in a string

🔥 Tomorrow’s Plan
1- continue with variable section til completion
