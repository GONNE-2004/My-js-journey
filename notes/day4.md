🔍 What I Learned Today
1-learnt about the use of different of math methods like Math.floor()
which rounds down to nearest integer - check mathbot.js!

2-learnt about truthy values (non-string, number other than 0 &-0, array,boolean(true), objects)
and falsy values (empy-strings, undefined, null, NaN(Not a Number),zero, boolean(false)),Simply put a
falsy values will not be logged into console if not true vice versa

3- learnt about ternary operator - (condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;):
use it when you have single condition instead of if\else statement
const temperature = 30;
const weather = temperature > 25 ? 'sunny' : 'cool';
<!-- console.log(`It's a ${weather} day!`); --> it's a sunny day! - check logicChecker.js

4-learnt about logical operators - (AND- &&: checks and returns true if both conditions're truthy),
(OR - || ckechs and returns if at least 1 condition is truthy),
(null - ?? returns 2nd values only if 1st value is null or undefined)

5- learnt about Type Coercion errors - check typeCoercionError.js

6- Checked fortunteller.js to use of math method like Math.random and learn about useing operator
such as === which is called strict equality, it checks both type and value before comparison

7- learn how use isNan() and Number.NaN  methods work in several cases and what causes NaN,
learnt uses of toFixed() method, learnt uses of parseInt() and parseFloat() methods work - check numberMathods.js

8- learn about the unary plus operator,his operator converts its operand into a number.
If the operand is already a number, it remains unchanged. and  Unary Negation (-) Operator:
This operator negates the operand. - check typeCoercionError.js

9-learnt about the bitwise operators, used inData Compression and Encryption,Performance Optimizations
Low-Level Programming these are just some of it's use case - check logicChecker.js

10-Leanrt about conditionals such the use of switch and if-else statements and when to use which. check conditionals.js

🧠 Key Takeaways
1-learnt many things which probably needs reviews once in a while
2-SWitch used when one to evaluate 1 values in many scenrios

❓ Questions / Things to Review Later
1- the ternary operator is for single condition use
2- check out the logical operators especially null - ??
3- there are many math method for every kind of complex calculation so don't reinvent the wheel
check them ou if possible
4- checkout the number methods such as Number.NaN(), they are useful when handling user input

🔥 Tomorrow’s Plan
1- start the function chapter
