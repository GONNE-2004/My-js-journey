[Go to Array subfolder in basic](file:../basics/Array/arrayMethod.js)

🔍 What I Learned Today
1-Learnt about array, 1 & 2 demensional array, index in an array begin at zero and to find an item in 2D you need to 1st know row index then 2nd the column index

2-learnt about the different methods of adding and removing items from an array like unshift (1 || more items) adds to an array start & shift (1 item) removes from array start, push (1 || more items) adds to an array end & pop (1) removes from array end

3-learnt about reversing a string which has 3 steps 1st-slipt() then 2nd-reveser() and.3rd-join()

4-learnt about destructiing an array, it's basically like tuple in python where a list of variables is created then assigned to an array and the index of the variable matches the string index in that array thus giving the ability to call the string by the corresponding similar index variable.

5-learnt about the rest method/operator(denoted by ...rest) can used to collect remaining function arguments or items when destructing

6-learnt about the spread operator(denoted by ...arrName) can be used to create a new array by combining existing arrays or copying items from an existing array

7-Created 2 small programs which both show cases inwhich array can be used

8-Learnt the use of array methode such as: splice()which helps remove an item from any place in array, index() helps find if item exist in array. includes() helps find if specific item exist in array, concat(),slice() & spread operator all help in copying item from array thus creating new shallow array -check arrayMethod.js

🧠 Key Takeaways
1-An array is an ordered collection of values, While it can technically hold different data types (in JS), it's generally best practice to keep the types consistent within a single array.

2-The rest method can only only be used in destructing to collect remaining items or collect remaining function arguments

❓ Questions / Things to Review Later
1-The rest methods/operators and spread method/operators have differnt purposes tho they both are denoted by (...arrNam or rest of the items in an array)
2-The spread method  can be used anywhere in an array and it either helps in copying, merging or expanding an array

🔥 Tomorrow’s Plan
1-Start the Objects chapter
