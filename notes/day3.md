🔍 What I Learned Today
1-learnt the use of includes( ) and slice() methods
2-learnt use of trim(),trimEnd(),trimStart() and use of toUpperCase() & toLowerCase() methods, its applications are
in stringFormat.js
3-learnt about repeat(), replace() and replaceAll() method used to create a new string from an existing one,  its applications are
in stringModify.js

🧠 Key Takeaways
1-Use repeat() method if you want a simple way to dublicate
2-Use trim() method if you want to remove spaces at start and end of a string

❓ Questions / Things to Review Later
1- trim() method doesn't remove the spaces within the string
2- replaceAll() changes all occurance of the specified values and replace() only changes the 1st occurance
3- repeat wll throw a RangeError if infinity is used

🔥 Tomorrow’s Plan
1- start the boolean chapter
