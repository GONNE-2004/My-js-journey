/* the switch statement checks the value of dayOfWeek and matches it to the corresponding case.
When a match is found, it executes the code block associated with that case.
 The break statement prevents fall-through to subsequent cases.
 If no match is found, the default case is executed.

 using swtich is good because it improves code readability and organization when dealing with multiple d
